                        <p>Our journey begins with a seemingly ordinary Instagram friend request. Harikrishna, who first noticed me through our mutual friend’s social media, took a leap of faith and reached out. Though I was hesitant and not quite ready for new connections in 2022, the universe had its own plans. Little did I know, this simple gesture would mark the beginning of something extraordinary.</p>

                        <h3>Chapter 2: Across the Miles</h3>
                        <p>On April 16, 2022, Harikrishna extended his reach beyond Instagram and sent me a friend request on Snapchat. Our conversations soon became a cherished routine, and my feelings for him grew with each passing day. However, fate threw a twist into our story when he was set to move to Australia on June 7, 2022. Though separated by continents, we remained inseparable through our heartfelt exchanges on Snapchat, letting our bond flourish despite the distance.</p>

                        <h3>Chapter 3: The Midnight Confession</h3>
                        <p>By July 17, 2022, the truth was revealed by one of Harikrishna’s old friends. My feelings had deepened and were now mutual. That night, despite the time zone difference, Harikrishna stayed awake to speak with me. His words, tender and sincere, culminated in a heartfelt proposal on July 19, 2022. As I said yes, we embarked on a new chapter as a couple, our hearts entwined across the miles.</p>

                        <p>Our long-distance relationship faced its fair share of trials, but each challenge only strengthened our love. In October 2022, Harikrishna’s visit to India turned fleeting moments into treasured memories. His time with me was precious, making every minute count. Even as he returned to Australia in January 2023, our bond remained steadfast. Though separated by distance, our hearts stayed closely connected, ready to embrace the next chapter of our journey together.</p>

                        <p>Our love story, tested by distance, only grew stronger with time. In October 2022, Harikrishna’s visit to India brought us together, transforming our long-distance relationship into a series of unforgettable moments. Despite his return to Australia in January 2023, our connection remained unbreakable. As we adapted to new ways of communication, our hearts remained intertwined, eagerly anticipating the next chapter of our life together.</p>
